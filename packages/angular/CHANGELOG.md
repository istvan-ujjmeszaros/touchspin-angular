# @touchspin/angular

## 5.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 380440f: - expose renderer entry points via npm package exports and keep renderer packages as optional peer dependencies only (consumers install whichever renderer they need).

## 5.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 2e84af9: Make renderer packages optional peer dependencies so consuming apps only pull the renderer(s) they use. This removes the transitive Bootstrap dependency when using the vanilla renderer. No API changes; reinstall after upgrading.

## 5.1.3

### Patch Changes

- afa486e: Republish the Angular adapter via the standard GitHub Actions release flow after cleaning up the 5.1.2 manual publish. No code changes; this simply bumps a patch version so consumers receive the package built in partial compilation mode with the restored renderer templates/providers.

## 5.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Rebuild the Angular adapter with the Angular 19 toolchain in partial compilation mode so it runs without shims on Angular 18/19/20 consumers.

## 5.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix: Ensure subpath exports are properly included in published package
  - Published package was missing subpath directories and exports field
  - Subpath exports now match the built dist contents
  - Users can import renderer components such as `@touchspin/angular/vanilla`

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 15e9601: Ship Angular adapter rebuilt with the Angular 20 toolchain: full AOT compilation, no JIT/runtime shims, updated unit test wiring, and verified Yarn-based consumer app flow.
