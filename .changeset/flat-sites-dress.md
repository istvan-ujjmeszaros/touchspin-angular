### Feat: Complete TouchSpin API support for Angular

Added complete TouchSpinHandle interface with all core methods (startUpSpin, startDownSpin, stopSpin, updateSettings) and TouchSpin event support (onMin, onMax, onStartSpin, onStopSpin, etc.) as Angular @Output() EventEmitters. Enhanced Angular 17 example to demonstrate all features with event tracking and imperative controls. Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions.
